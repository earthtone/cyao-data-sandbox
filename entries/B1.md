Albetan cracks his fingers and clears his throat. The barsiphone was in the closet, and had needed a thorough cleaning; adjusting the strings, realigning the keys, he’d done both a week prior, but he was sure it couldn’t be over-done. He sat the instrument across his lap, and now lowers his fingers to play-

No, no. He can’t play sitting on the bed,

A chair must be cleared off, a table. And the sun must hit exactly right and certain windows closed and others open, to filter the chirping and haggling from outside. And now something to drink, perhaps a snack before he plays? Or some inspiration?
