Albetan finds his notebook. It’s fresh, having ripped the first few pages out as he’d worked the last few weeks. He even finds the pencil he’d left with it. He is envigorated. Today is the day. Today is the masterpiece.

“Today” he writes, tapping his pencil on it after, underlining and then circling.

“Here” he crosses it out

“Today” he writes again, below.

Perhaps it’s too loud. He closes the thick shades. Now it’s too dark, and he lights a candle. Albetan stars at the flame.

“Flame” he writes under “today” now circling them both.

He circlea them again. Humming to himself. Repeating them.

“Today flame, today flame, flame today, todayayayay flayayayayayame.”

He puts the pencil and notebook down. Tearing off the page as he goes.
