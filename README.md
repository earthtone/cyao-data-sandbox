# CYAO DATA

Collection of CYAO entries written as [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) with [Front Matter](http://assemble.io/docs/YAML-front-matter.html) metadata.

## Notes

- `/entries` directory houses each entry as Markdown, with entry metadata (i.e. id, links list) as front matter.
- `compile` script creates a new `JSON` file with the latest markdown entries from a given path argument.
